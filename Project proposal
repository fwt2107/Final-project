Tentative Project Title: “Asthma-related health outcomes and air quality in NYC”
 
Motivation: We are interested in the effects of the environment, such as air quality, on health outcomes like asthma among New York City residents. We are curious if the potential effects of air quality on asthma-related health outcomes differ across boroughs, income level, years, neighborhoods, and age groups.
 
Intended final products: A website displaying our analyses, a screencast, and a written report discussing our exploratory analyses and main results.
 
Anticipated data sources: 
•	NYC Open Data on Air Quality https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r
•	NYC income data https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Income-By-Type-Of-Income-And-AGI-Range/gffu-ps8j
 
Planned analyses/visualizations: 
- GIS visualization - neighborhood/census tract visualization of case cluster
- Barplot of health outcomes (attributable deaths, asthma ED visits, and hospitalizations) vs neighborhood demographics
- Spaghetti plot displaying rate of asthma-related ED visits over time by borough
- Graph displaying how different age groups (children, adults, elderly) may be affected differently by air quality in health outcomes

Coding challenges:
•	Cleaning/tidying the dataset
•	Merging health outcome data with GIS map data 
•	Attempting to use API to keep data live and up to date - “our legacy”
•	Ensuring our analyses answer and address our main questions/motivations

Planned timeline:
-          November 12-16 - Project review meeting
-          November 17 - Finalize what analyses and visualizations to include
-          November 18 - Delegate analyses and visualizations
-          November 29 - Group meeting to go over progress and update each other
-          December 2 - Complete analyses and visualizations
-          December 3 - Create website 
-          December 4 - Record screencast
-          December 5 - Review website and screencast
-          December 6 - Submit final project
